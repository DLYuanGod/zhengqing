**I will be attending the University of Notre Dame in August 2024 and pursuing a PhD under the guidance of Prof. Yanfang Ye.**

I am currently an undergraduate student at [Anhui Polytechnic University](https://www.ahpu.edu.cn/) and also the leader of the Natural Language Processing Research Group at School of Artificial Intelligence.

I am now working on NLP, deep learning (about methods of training models), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal training research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [zhengqingyuan@ieee.org](mailto:zhengqingyuan@ieee.org).

Due to my excellent research ability, I am known as the most powerful undergraduate student at Anhui Polytechnic University.

My research interest includes NLP, deep learning (about methods of trainning models), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal training.
