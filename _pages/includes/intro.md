I am currently an undergraduate student at [Anhui Polytechnic University](https://www.ahpu.edu.cn/) and also the leader of the Natural Language Processing Research Group at School of Artificial Intelligence.

I am now working on NLP, deep learning (about methods of trainning models), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal training research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [zhengqingyuan@ieee.org](mailto:zhengqingyuan@ieee.org).

Due to my excellent research ability, I am known as the most powerful undergraduate student at Anhui Polytechnic University.

My research interest includes NLP, deep learning (about methods of trainning models), large language models (LLMs) and multimodal training. 

As first author, I have written more than five papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dTu07l8AAAAJ'> at the SCI Journal and international AI conferences. 

**I am eagerly looking to enroll as a Ph.D. candidate in 2024 and would be delighted if any prospective professors interested in my profile could reach out to me at [zhengqingyuan@ieee.org](mailto:zhengqingyuan@ieee.org). I will reply to you as soon as I see it. Welcome by your invitation.**
